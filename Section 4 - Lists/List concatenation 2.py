# Purpose: A program to demonstrate list concatenation

# Concatenate two lists by extending one of them
boysNames = ['John', 'Jim', 'Alex', 'Fred']
girlsNames = ['Sarah', 'Alex', 'Pat', 'Mary']
boysNames = boysNames + girlsNames
print(boysNames)

# NOTE: Just because the above list is called 'boysNames'
# does not mean that girls' names cannot be stored in it.
