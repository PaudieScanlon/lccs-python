Could start off with a class discussion ...
1. Ask students to explain the flowchart. What are in inputs? Outputs? Processing?
2. Discuss the variable 'mark'? How might 'mark' be populated?
3. Discuss the implication(s) of testing 'mark >= 0' first and working up (as opposed to starting off with the test, 'mark >= 90')

Some ideas for extensions ...
1. Implement the logic of the flowchart in a Python program
2. What about Ordinary level (i.e. O1 ... O8)?
3. Read a set number of marks (e.g. 6 marks) from a file
4. Add functionallity to calculate the total number of CAO points based on the 6 marks. What about bonus points?
5. What about taking in more than 6 marks and calculating the points based on the 6 best marks
6. Incorporate the use of lists
