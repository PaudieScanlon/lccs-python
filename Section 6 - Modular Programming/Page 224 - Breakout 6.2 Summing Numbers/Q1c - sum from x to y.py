# Explanation.
# The sum of the numbers from x to y is the same as .....
# ... the sum of the numbers from 1 to y minus ...
# ... the sum of the numbers from 1 to x-1
# Example: The sum of the numbers from 8 to 13 = (1+2+3+...+11+12+13) - (1+2+3+...+6+7)
# So, sum(8..13) = sum(1..13) - sum(1..7)
# The reason we subtract sum(1..7) and not sum(1..8) is because we want to include 8 in the final sum
